- Reference stored access policies where possible. 
- Use near-term expiration times on an unplanned SAS
- Have clients automatically renew the SAS if necessary
- Be careful with SAS start time
- Be specific with the resource to be accessed.
- Understand that your account will be billed for any usage, including that done with SAS
- Validate data written using SAS
- Don't assume SAS is always the correct choice.
- Use Storage Analytics to monitor your application
