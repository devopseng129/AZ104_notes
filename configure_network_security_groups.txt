Implement network security groups
- NSG
- subnets
- network interfaces
- associations

Determine network security group rules
- filter the type of network traffic that can flow in and out of virtual network subnets and network interfaces
- specifying:
    Name
    Priority
    Port
    Protocol (Any, TCP, UDP)
    Source (Any, IP Addresses, Service tag)
    Destination (Any, IP Addresses, Virtual Network)
    Action (Allow or Deny)
- inbound rules
- outbound rules


Determine network security group effective rules
- service 
- port ranges
- Priority (lower number == higher priority)
