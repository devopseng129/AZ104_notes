Acess Azure Storage
- public access - anonymous client access
- AAD - authenticate a security principal -> get OAuth 2.0 token -> Azure Storage authorization
- Shared Key - two 512-bit access keys for every storage account that's created
- shared access signature SAS - grant granular access to files in Azure Storage
    user delegation SAS
    Service SAS
    Account SAS


Shared Access Signatures
- resource URI + SAS token
- SAS token
    sp= Controls the access rights (a for add, c for create, d for delete, l for list, r for read, or w for write.)
    st= date and time when access starts
    se= date and time when access ends
    sv= version of the storage API to use
    sr=  kind of storage being accessed
    sig=  cryptographic signature


Reduce the potential risks of using a SAS
- always use HTTPS
- the most secure SAS is a user delegation SAS
- try to set expiration time to the smallest useful value
- apply the rule of minimum-required privileges
- there are some situations where a SAS isn't the correct solution

SAS
- a secure way to give access to clients without having to share your Azure credentials
- downside - Anyone with the correct SAS can access the file while it's still valid

Media for storing access policy
- blob containers
- file shares
- queues
- tables

Stored access policy properties
- identifier
- start time
- expiry time
- permissions
