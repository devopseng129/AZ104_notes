Plan virtual networks
- VNet - a representation of your own network in the cloud
- Each VNet you create has its own CIDR block and can be linked to other VNets and on-premises networks if the CIDR blocks do not overlap
- usage
     dedicated private cloud-only VNet
     Securely extend your data center With VNets (S2S-VPN-IPSEC)
     Enable hybrid cloud scenarios.

Create subnets
- provide logical divisions within your network.
- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation
- 5 restricted addresses in Azure
    x.x.x.0: Network address
    x.x.x.1: Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
    x.x.x.2, x.x.x.3: Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IPs to the VNet space
    x.x.x.255: Network broadcast address

Plan IP addressing
    Private IP addresses: Used for communication within an Azure virtual network (VNet), and your on-premises network, when you use a VPN gateway or ExpressRoute circuit to extend your network to Azure.
    Public IP addresses: Used for communication with the Internet, including Azure public-facing services.
    Static addressing usage
        DNS name resolution, where a change in the IP address would require updating host records.
        IP address-based security models that require apps or services to have a static IP address.
        TSL/SSL certificates linked to an IP address.
        Firewall rules that allow or deny traffic using IP address ranges.
        Role-based VMs such as Domain Controllers and DNS servers.


Create public IP addressing
- IP version
- SKU
- name
- IP address assignment
    dynamic
    static

Associate public IP addresses
VM -> NIC
LoadBalancer -> front-end configuration
VPN gateway -> Gateway IP configuration
Application Gateway -> front-end configuration
