There are three ranges of non-routable IP addresses that are designed for internal networks that won't be sent over internet routers:

    10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
    172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

Public and private IP addressing in Azure
IP address types

There are two types of IP addresses that you can use in Azure:

    Public IP addresses 
    Private IP addresses

Both types of IP addresses can be allocated in one of two ways:

    Dynamic
    Static

In Azure virtual networks, IP addresses can be allocated to the following types of resources:

    Virtual machine network interfaces
    Load balancers
    Application gateways
