Connect services by using virtual network peering
2 types
    Virtual network peering connects virtual networks in the same Azure region, such as two virtual networks in North Europe.
    Global virtual network peering connects virtual networks that are in different Azure regions, such as a virtual network in North Europe and a virtual network in West Europe.

IP address spaces of connected networks within Azure and between Azure and your on-premises system can't overlap
