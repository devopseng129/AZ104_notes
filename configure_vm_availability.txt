configure_vm_availability

Plan for maintenance and downtime
- unplanned hardware maintenance
- unexpected downtime
- planned maintenance

Setup availability sets
- availability set - logica feature - ensure that group of related VMs are deployed so that they are not subject to a SPF and not upgraded at the same time
- general principles
    redundancy - multiple VMs in an Av-Setup
    configure each application tier into separate Av-Setup
    combine Load Balancer with Av-sets
    use managed disks with VMs

Review update and fault domains
UD - update domain - group of nodes that are upgraded together during the process of a rollout
FD - fault domain - group of nodes that represent a physical unit of failure


availability zones
- unique physical locations within the Azure region
- services
    zonal 
    zone-redundant 

vertical and horizontal scaling
- V - scale up/down
- H - scale out/in



scale sets
- VM scale sets - Azure Compute resource
- deploy and manage a set of identical VMs
- designed to support true autoscale

Create scale sets
- initial instance count 
- instance size
- use managed disks
- enabling scalling beyond 100 instances
- spreading algorithm

Configure autoscale
- minimum number of VMs
- maximum number of VMs
- Scale out CPU threshold
- number of VMs in increase step
- Scale in CPU threshold
- number of VMs in decrease step
