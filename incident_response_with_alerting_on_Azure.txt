Explore the different alert types that Azure Monitor supports
- three signal types that you can use to monitor your environment
    metric
    activity
    log

- composition of an alert rule
    RESOURCE
    CONDITION
    ACTIONS
    ALERT DETAILS

    The five severity levels are:
    0: Critical
    1: Error
    2: Warning
    3: Informational
    4: Verbose

- filter alerts
    smart groups
    resource types
    resource
    severity
    monitor condition 
    alert state

Use log alerts to alert on events in your application
- capture important information from log files. These log files can be created by applications, operating systems, other hardware, or Azure services.

Composition of log search rules
- Every log alert has an associated search rule. The composition of these rules is:
    Log query: Query that runs every time the alert rule fires.
    Time period: Time range for the query.
    Frequency: How often the query should run.
    Threshold: Trigger point for an alert to be created.



Use activity log alerts to alert on events within your Azure infrastructure
- be notified when a specific event happens on some Azure resource

- There are two types of activity log alerts:
    Specific operations: Apply to resources within your Azure subscription, and often have a scope with specific resources or a resource group. You use this type when you need to receive an alert that reports a change to an aspect of your subscription. For example, you can receive an alert if a VM is deleted or new roles are assigned to a user.
    Service health events: Include notice of incidents and maintenance of target resources.

- activity log alerts attributes
    category
    scope
    resource group
    resource type
    operation name
    level
    status
    event initiated by

- perform actions when alert happens
    Send an email.
    Send an SMS message.
    Create an Azure app push notification.
    Make a voice call to a number.
    Call an Azure function.
    Trigger a logic app.
    Send a notification to a webhook.
    Create an ITSM ticket.
    Use a runbook (to restart a VM, or scale a VM up or down).


Use smart groups to reduce alert noise in Azure Monitor
- Smart groups are an automatic feature of Azure Monitor. By using machine learning algorithms, Azure Monitor joins alerts based on repeat occurrence or similarity. Smart groups enable you to address a group of alerts instead of each alert individually.
